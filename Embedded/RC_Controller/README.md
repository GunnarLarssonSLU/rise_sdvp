Below you find information on important files in the folder and what to find where. (in progress..)

The card runs [ChibioOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChibiOS/RT). You can find more information on the operating system at https://www.chibios.org/dokuwiki/doku.php.

A very short summary of the information flow on the card is:
- Upon start 'main' in 'main.c' is execute in order to initiate various processes
- Among these processes it starts to read data from the usb port on the card. The data is processed by 'commands_process_packet' in 'commands.c'. All communication to the card is processed by this function (not all communication to the vehicle reaches the card, for example if a camera is used that is handled directly by the raspberry pi)
- In many cases the processing of the informtion will lead to 'commands_send_packet' (also in 'commands.c') being called to return data via the usb port.

# Main

The main function initiates all threads running on the card. Logging and timeout settings are set directly in the file


# Autopilot

Functions related to the autopilot. The function autopilot_init() is initiated at startup.

*autopilot_init()

Set values to default value. Register the terminal commands below. Does not start any functions.

# Hydraulic

Starts thread "Hydraulic". hydraulic.init() starts at startup. It only sets default values.

Currently controls the vehicle powertrain via the controller card whilst the hydraulic implements (front/back) is controlled via a bespoke IO-card.

## Important functions

| Function | Description | Input (description) (type) | Output (description) (type) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| THD_FUNCTION |  .. | .. | .. |
| hydraulic_set_speed | Sets vehicles speed (m/s) | (float) (speed) | |
| hydraulic_move | Change state hydraulic implements | (item, state) (int, int) | |

# Pos ([more information](pos.md))

Functions related to calculating the vehicles position. The functions pos_init() and pos_uwb_init() are initiated at startup.

*void pos_init(void);

Initiates the positioning. Set variables to zero, initiates imu, starts ahrs, starts ublox. Adds some terminal commands.


*void pos_pps_cb(EXTDriver *extp, expchannel_t channel);
*void pos_get_imu(float *accel, float *gyro, float *mag);
*void pos_get_quaternions(float *q);
*void pos_get_pos(POS_STATE *p);

*int32_t pos_get_ms_today(void);
*void pos_set_ms_today(int32_t ms);
*bool pos_input_nmea(const char *data);

*void pos_reset_attitude(void);
*int pos_time_since_gps_corr(void);
*void pos_base_rtcm_obs(rtcm_obs_header_t *header, rtcm_obs_t *obs, int obs_num);



# Timeout

## Important functions
- timeout_reset      Resets the timeout counter. Can be called from anywhere in the project. Is called in commands.c by various functions, most importantly 
- THD_FUNCTION       Stops autopilot unless timeout_reset has been called within a certain set time interval 

## Settings

- m_timeout_msec = 2000
- m_last_update_time = 0
- m_timeout_brake_current = 0.0
- m_has_timeout = false

# Servo simple ([more information](servo_simple.md))

Functions for controling and reading servo information. The servos are controlled by the controller card.

# Utils

Various useful functions
