Functions related to calculating the vehicles position.

The summary is based on that the unit has a [BMI160](https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/products/motion-sensors/imus/bmi160/) (which the F9-card used by Macbot & Dr√§ngen has). Though almost all will be true matter if it hasn't.


Functions called during initiation:
- ahrs_init_attitude_info
- bmi160_wrapper_init (with a sample rate of 500 hz)
- bmi160_wrapper_set_read_callback (with function mpu9150_read)
- bldc_interface_set_rx_value_func (with mc_values_received)
- ublox_set_rx_callback_relposned(with ublox_relposned_rx)
- ublox_set_rx_callback_rawx (with ubx_rx_rawx)
- save_pos_history()

During initiation it also sets a large number of variable to zero and terminal commands list below are initiated.

void pos_set_ms_today(int32_t ms);
bool pos_input_nmea(const char *data);
void pos_reset_attitude(void);
int pos_time_since_gps_corr(void);
void pos_base_rtcm_obs(rtcm_obs_header_t *header, rtcm_obs_t *obs, int obs_num);

### mpu9150_read

This function does quite a lot of processing to handle both imu data
